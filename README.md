# Employee Attrition Analysis - Green Destination

This project analyzes employee attrition data from the travel agency **Green Destination** to discover trends in age, income, and tenure that may influence why employees leave.

## Objective

The HR director observed increasing attrition and wants to understand:
- What is the attrition rate?
- Do **age**, **monthly income**, or **years at company** affect attrition?

---

## Tools Used

- **Python (Google Colab)**: Data analysis and boxplots
- **Tableau Public**: Data visualizations
- **GitHub**: Project hosting and documentation

---

## Dataset

The dataset `greendestination.csv` includes employee details like:
- Attrition status
- Age, Monthly Income, Years at Company etc

---

## Key Findings

### 1. Years at Company
- Avg years (Left): `5.13`  
- Avg years (Stayed): `7.36`  
> **Employees with fewer years at the company are more likely to leave.**

### 2. Age
- Avg age (Left): `33.6`  
- Avg age (Stayed): `37.56`  
> **Younger employees are slightly more likely to leave.**

### 3. Monthly Income
- Avg income (Left): `₹4787`  
- Avg income (Stayed): `₹6832`  
> **Lower income employees are significantly more likely to leave.**

---

## Conclusion

**Monthly Income** showed the strongest relationship with attrition, followed by **Years at Company**, and **Age**. HR can use this insight to create policies for employee retention.
